We can calculate the age at the time of diagnosis using the `CHARTTIME` from the `diagnoses_icd` table and ensure it is 60 or above.\n\n- **Time Frame for Prescription**: We need to identify prescriptions given within 2 months after the diagnosis. Using the `prescriptions` table, we can find prescriptions with `STARTDATE` within 2 months of the `CHARTTIME` of the diagnosis.\n\n- **Drug Identification**: The `prescriptions` table contains information about drugs prescribed, including `DRUG`, `DOSE_VAL_RX`, `DOSE_UNIT_RX`, and `ROUTE`.

patients were prescribed with morphine sulfate during the same hospital visit after being diagnosed with mitral valve disorder since 2015, the following background knowledge and context information would be helpful:\n\n1. **Identifying the Diagnosis:**\n   - \"Mitral valve disorder\" is a diagnosis, so we need to find the corresponding ICD9_CODE for this condition in the `d_icd_diagnoses` table. This will allow us to identify patients diagnosed with this condition.\n\n2. **Finding Diagnosed Patients:**\n   - Once we have the ICD9_CODE for mitral valve disorder, we can use it to find the relevant `HADM_ID` (hospital admission ID) in the `diagnoses_icd` table. This will give us the list of hospital visits where patients were diagnosed with mitral valve disorder.\n\n3. **Identifying Prescriptions:**\n   - \"Morphine sulfate\" is a medication, so we need to check the `prescriptions` table to find records where this drug was prescribed. We will look for entries with the `DRUG` field matching \"morphine sulfate.\"\n\n4. **Matching Hospital Visits:**\n   - We need to ensure that the prescription of morphine sulfate occurred during the same hospital visit as the diagnosis of mitral valve disorder. This means matching the `HADM_ID` from the `diagnoses_icd` table with the `HADM_ID` in the `prescriptions` table.\n\n5. **Filtering by Date:**\n   - Since the question specifies \"since 2015,\" we need to filter the records to include only those hospital visits and prescriptions that occurred on or after January 1, 2015. This can be done by checking the `CHARTTIME` or relevant date fields in the `diagnoses_icd` and `prescriptions` tables.\n\n6. **Counting Unique Patients:**\n   - Finally, we need to count the number of unique `SUBJECT_ID` (patient IDs) who meet the criteria of having been diagnosed with mitral valve disorder and prescribed morphine sulfate during the same hospital visit since 2015.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of patients who were prescribed morphine sulfate during the same hospital visit after being diagnosed with mitral valve disorder since 2015.", "code": "# Load the necessary databases\nd_icd_diagnoses_db = LoadDB('d_icd_diagnoses')\ndiagnoses_icd_db = LoadDB('diagnoses_icd')\nprescriptions_db = LoadDB('prescriptions')\n\n# Find the ICD9_CODE for \"mitral valve disorder\"\nmitral_valve_disorder_db = FilterDB(d_icd_diagnoses_db, \"LONG_TITLE like '%mitral valve disorder%'\")\nmitral_valve_disorder_icd9_code = GetValue(mitral_valve_disorder_db, 'ICD9_CODE')\n\n# Properly format the ICD9_CODE for SQL IN clause\nmitral_valve_disorder_icd9_code_list = ', '.join([f\"'{code.strip()}'\" for code in mitral_valve_disorder_icd9_code.split(',')])\n\n# Find the HADM_IDs for the diagnosis since 2015\ndiagnosed_hadm_ids_db = FilterDB(diagnoses_icd_db, f\"ICD9_CODE in ({mitral_valve_disorder_icd9_code_list}), CHARTTIME>='2015-01-01'\")\ndiagnosed_hadm_ids = GetValue(diagnosed_hadm_ids_db, 'HADM_ID')\n\n# Filter prescriptions for morphine sulfate\nmorphine_sulfate_prescriptions_db = FilterDB(prescriptions_db, \"DRUG like '%morphine sulfate%'\")\nmorphine_sulfate_hadm_ids = GetValue(morphine_sulfate_prescriptions_db, 'HADM_ID')\n\n# Find the intersection of HADM_IDs between diagnoses and prescriptions\ncommon_hadm_ids = set(diagnosed_hadm_ids.split(', ')).intersection(set(morphine_sulfate_hadm_ids.split(', ')))\n\n# Filter the prescriptions for those with the common HADM_IDs\ncommon_prescriptions_db = FilterDB(morphine_sulfate_prescriptions_db, 'HADM_ID in (' + ', '.join(common_hadm_ids) + ')')\n\n# Get unique SUBJECT_IDs of patients who meet the criteria\nunique_subject_ids = GetValue(common_prescriptions_db, 'SUBJECT_ID, distinct')\n\n# Count the number of unique patients\nnumber_of_patients = len(unique_subject_ids.split(', '))\n\n# Save the answer\nanswer = number_of_patients\nanswer"}, {"question": "tell me the last specimen test that patient 71689 was given on this hospital encounter?", "knowledge": "- To determine the last specimen test given to patient 71689 during a specific hospital encounter, we first need to identify the relevant hospital admission using the admissions database, which contains information such as SUBJECT_ID and HADM_ID.\n\n- Once we have the HADM_ID for the specific encounter, we can look into the microbiologyevents database, which records specimen tests.

we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the First Hospital Visit:**\n   - Use the `admissions` table to find all hospital visits for patient 4495 by querying with `SUBJECT_ID = 4495`.\n   - Determine the first hospital visit by sorting the visits by `ADMITTIME` and selecting the earliest one. Note the `HADM_ID` for this visit.\n\n2. **Find Age During First Visit:**\n   - Use the `patients` table to find the date of birth (`DOB`) for patient 4495.\n   - Calculate the age at the time of the first hospital visit using the `ADMITTIME` from the `admissions` table and the `DOB`.\n\n3. **Retrieve Hematocrit Lab Test Results:**\n   - Use the `labevents` table to find all hematocrit lab test results for patient 4495 during their first hospital visit by querying with `SUBJECT_ID = 4495` and the identified `HADM_ID`.\n   - Ensure that the `ITEMID` corresponds to hematocrit by joining with the `d_labitems` table to confirm the correct `ITEMID` for hematocrit.\n\n4. **Calculate Percentile:**\n   - Collect all `VALUENUM` entries for hematocrit tests from the `labevents` table for patients of the same age as patient 4495 during their first hospital visit.\n   - Determine the percentile of the value 26.5 within this distribution of hematocrit values.\n\nBy following these steps, you can determine the percentile of the hematocrit value 26.5 for patient 4495 during their first hospital visit, considering patients of the same age.", "code": "# Load the patients database to get the date of birth for patient 4495\npatients_db = LoadDB('patients')\nfiltered_patients_db = FilterDB(patients_db, 'SUBJECT_ID=4495')\ndob = GetValue(filtered_patients_db, 'DOB')\n\n# Load the admissions database to get the first hospital visit for patient 4495\nadmissions_db = LoadDB('admissions')\nfiltered_admissions_db = FilterDB(admissions_db, 'SUBJECT_ID=4495')\nfirst_admission_time = GetValue(filtered_admissions_db, 'ADMITTIME, min')\nfirst_hadm_id = GetValue(filtered_admissions_db, 'HADM_ID, min')\n\n# Calculate the age of patient 4495 during their first hospital visit\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndob_date = datetime.strptime(dob, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')\nfirst_admission_date = datetime.strptime(first_admission_time, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')\nage_at_first_visit = (first_admission_date -

This can be done by looking up the condition in the `d_icd_diagnoses` table, which contains the definitions and codes for diagnoses.\n\n2. **Find the Relevant Diagnoses**: Once we have the ICD9_CODE for atrial flutter, we can search the `diagnoses_icd` table for entries that match this code and are associated with patient 12927. This table will provide us with the HADM_IDs and CHARTTIME for each diagnosis.\n\n3. **Determine the Current Hospital Encounter**: We need to identify the current hospital encounter for patient 12927. This can be done by checking the `admissions` table for the most recent HADM_ID associated with patient 12927.\n\n4. **Filter Diagnoses by Current Encounter**: With the current HADM_ID, we can filter the entries in the `diagnoses_icd` table to find the last occurrence of atrial flutter during this specific hospital encounter.\n\n5. **Calculate Elapsed Days**: Once we have the CHARTTIME of the last atrial flutter diagnosis, we can calculate the number of days that have elapsed since that date. This can be done by comparing the CHARTTIME to the current date or the discharge date (if the patient has been discharged), which can be found in the `admissions` table.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine how many days have passed since patient 12927 was last diagnosed with atrial flutter during their current hospital stay.", "code": "# Load the d_icd_diagnoses database to find the ICD9_CODE for \"atrial flutter\"\nd_icd_diagnoses_db = LoadDB('d_icd_diagnoses')\n\n# Filter the d_icd_diagnoses database for entries containing \"atrial flutter\"\nfiltered_d_icd_diagnoses_db = FilterDB(d_icd_diagnoses_db, 'LONG_TITLE LIKE \"%atrial flutter%\"')\n\n# Get the ICD9_CODE for atrial flutter (assuming it's the first match)\natrial_flutter_icd9_code = GetValue(filtered_d_icd_diagnoses_db, 'ICD9_CODE')\n\n# Load the diagnoses_icd database to find the diagnoses for patient 12927\n# and filter for the atrial flutter ICD9_CODE\ndiagnoses_icd_db = LoadDB('diagnoses_icd')\n\n# Since the previous attempt failed, let's ensure we only use the first ICD9_CODE\natrial_flutter_icd9_code = atrial_flutter_icd9_code.split(', ')[0]\n\nfiltered_diagnoses_icd_db = FilterDB(diagnoses_icd_db, f'SUBJECT_ID=12927, ICD9_CODE={atrial_flutter_icd9_code}')\n\n# Get the HADM_ID and the CHARTTIME of the last diagnosis of atrial flutter\nlast_atrial_flutter_charttime = GetValue(filtered_diagnoses_icd_db, 'CHARTTIME, max')\ncurrent_hadm_id = int(GetValue(filtered_diagnoses_icd_db, 'HADM_ID, max'))\n\n# Load the admissions database to confirm the current hospital encounter\nadmissions_db = LoadDB('admissions')\nfiltered_admissions_db = FilterDB(admissions_db, f'SUBJECT_ID=12927, HADM_ID={current_hadm_id}')\n\n# Get the DISCHTIME if the patient has been discharged\ndischtime = GetValue(filtered_admissions_db, 'DISCHTIME')\n\n# Calculate the number of days since the last diagnosis of atrial flutter\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Convert CHARTTIME to datetime object\nlast_atrial_flutter_charttime_datetime = datetime.strptime(last_atrial_flutter_charttime, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')\n\n# Determine the reference time (current time or discharge time)\nif dischtime:\n    reference_time = datetime.strptime(dischtime, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')\nelse:\n    reference_time = datetime.now()\n\n# Calculate the difference in days\ndays_elapsed = (reference_time - last_atrial_flutter_charttime_datetime).days\n\n# Save the answer\nanswer = days_elapsed\nanswer"}, {"question": "what is the drug that patient 54386 was prescribed with within 2 days after having undergone entral infus nutrit sub on the last hospital encounter?", "knowledge": "- To determine the last hospital encounter for patient 54386, we can look up their admission records in the admissions database using SUBJECT_ID 54386 and identify the most recent HADM_ID.\n\n- The procedure \"entral infus nutrit sub\" is likely associated with a specific ICD9_CODE, which can be found in the d_icd_procedures database by matching the SHORT_TITLE or LONG_TITLE.\n\n- Once the ICD9_CODE for \"entral infus nutrit sub\" is identified, we can search the procedures_icd database to find the corresponding HADM_ID and CHARTTIME for when this procedure was performed on patient 54386.\n\n- With the HADM_ID and the CHARTTIME of the procedure, we can determine the timeframe for the prescription by looking at the prescriptions database.

This can be done by checking the `ADMITTIME` field in the `admissions` table.\n\n- **Linking Diagnoses to Patients**: Diagnoses are recorded in the `diagnoses_icd` table, which includes `SUBJECT_ID` and `HADM_ID` to link diagnoses to specific patients and hospital admissions. \n\n- **Identifying Diagnoses**: The `diagnoses_icd` table contains `ICD9_CODE`, which can be cross-referenced with the `d_icd_diagnoses` table to obtain the `SHORT_TITLE` or `LONG_TITLE` of the diagnosis, providing a human-readable name for the diagnosis.\n\n- **Frequency Calculation**: To determine the most frequent diagnoses, you would count the occurrences of each `ICD9_CODE` for the filtered set of patients and admissions. Sorting these counts in descending order will help identify the top four most frequent diagnoses.\n\n- **Data Joining**: You will need to join the `patients`, `admissions`, and `diagnoses_icd` tables to filter and aggregate the data appropriately. Specifically, join `patients` and `admissions` on `SUBJECT_ID` to calculate age and filter by year, and join `admissions` and `diagnoses_icd` on `HADM_ID` to link diagnoses to the filtered admissions.\n\nBy using this knowledge, you can construct a query or series of queries to retrieve the top four most frequent diagnoses for patients aged in their 20s admitted in the year 2105.", "code": "# Load the necessary databases\npatients_db = LoadDB('patients')\nadmissions_db = LoadDB('admissions')\ndiagnoses_icd_db = LoadDB('diagnoses_icd')\nd_icd_diagnoses_db = LoadDB('d_icd_diagnoses')\n\n# Set the reference year to determine the age of patients in 2105\nreference_year = 2105\n\n# Calculate the birth year range for patients in their 20s in 2105\nbirth_year_start = reference_year - 29  # 2076\nbirth_year_end = reference_year - 20   # 2085\n\n# Filter patients who are in their 20s in 2105\npatients_in_20s_db = FilterDB(patients_db, f\"DOB >= {birth_year_start}-01-01, DOB <= {birth_year_end}-12-31\")\n\n# Get the SUBJECT_IDs of patients in their 20s\nsubject_ids_in_20s = GetValue(patients_in_20s_db, 'SUBJECT_ID')\n\n# Filter admissions for these patients in the year 2105\nadmissions_in_20s_db = FilterDB(admissions_db, f'SUBJECT_ID in ({subject_ids_in_20s}), ADMITTIME >= 2105-01-01, ADMITTIME < 2106-01-01')\n\n# Get the HADM_IDs for these admissions\nhadm_ids_in_20s = GetValue(admissions_in_20s_db, 'HADM_ID')\n\n# Filter diagnoses for these admissions\ndiagnoses_in_20s_db = FilterDB(diagnoses_icd_db, f'HADM_ID in ({hadm_ids_in_20s})')\n\n# Count the frequency of each diagnosis\nicd9_code_counts = GetValue(diagnoses_in_20s_db, 'ICD9_CODE, count')\n\n# Sort the ICD9 codes by frequency and select the top four\nsorted_icd9_codes = sorted(icd9_code_counts, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:4]\n\n# Retrieve the names (SHORT_TITLE) of the top four diagnoses\ndiagnosis_names = []\nfor icd9_code, _ in sorted_icd9_codes:\n    filtered_d_icd_diagnoses_db = FilterDB(d_icd_diagnoses_db, f'ICD9_CODE={icd9_code}')\n    short_title = GetValue(filtered_d_icd_diagnoses_db, 'SHORT_TITLE')\n    diagnosis_names.append(short_title)\n\n# Save the answer\nanswer = ', '.join(diagnosis_names)\nanswer"}, {"question": "how many times has patient 31141 received sm bowel endoscopy nec since 2104?", "knowledge": "- \"Sm bowel endoscopy nec\" is a procedure, so the corresponding ICD9_CODE can be found in the d_icd_procedures database.\n- Once the ICD9_CODE is identified, it can be used to find the relevant records in the procedures_icd database, which contains information about procedures performed on patients.\n- The procedures_icd database can be queried for records associated with patient 31141 using their SUBJECT_ID and the identified ICD9_CODE.\n- The query should filter records based on the CHARTTIME to ensure they are from the year 2104 onwards.\n- The count of these records will provide the number of times patient 31141 has received the procedure \"sm bowel endoscopy nec\" since 2104.", "code": "# Load the d_icd_procedures database to find ICD9_CODE for \"sm bowel endoscopy nec\"\nd_icd_procedures_db = LoadDB('d_icd_procedures')\n\n# Filter the database for procedures containing \"sm bowel endoscopy nec\" to find the correct ICD9_CODE\nsm_bowel_endoscopy_db = FilterDB(d_icd_procedures_db, \"LONG_TITLE like '%sm bowel endoscopy nec%'\")\n\n# Get the ICD9_CODE for \"sm bowel endoscopy nec\"\nsm_bowel_endoscopy_icd9_codes = GetValue(sm_bowel_endoscopy_db, 'ICD9_CODE').split(', ')\n\n# Convert the list of ICD9 codes into a format suitable for SQL IN clause\nicd9_code_list = ', '.join([f'\"{code}\"' for code in sm_bowel_endoscopy_icd9_codes])\n\n# Load the procedures_icd database to find entries with the specific ICD9_CODE\nprocedures_icd_db = LoadDB('procedures_icd')\n\n# Filter the procedures for patient 31141 and the specific ICD9_CODE since 2104\npatient_procedures_since_2104_db = FilterDB(procedures_icd_db, f'SUBJECT_ID=31141 and ICD9_CODE IN ({icd9_code_list}) and CHARTTIME>=\"2104-01-01\"')\n\n# Count the number of times \"sm bowel endoscopy nec\" was performed on patient 31141 since 2104\nsm_bowel_endoscopy_count = len(GetValue(patient_procedures_since_2104_db, 'ICD9_CODE').split(', '))\n\n# Save the answer\nanswer = sm_bowel_endoscopy_count"}, {"question": "a year before, how many patients received sympath nerve inject nec within 2 months after the diagnosis of crbl emblsm w infrct?", "knowledge": "- The diagnosis \"crbl emblsm w infrct\" corresponds to an ICD9_CODE, which can be found in the `d_icd_diagnoses` table.\n- Using the ICD9_CODE for \"crbl emblsm w infrct,\" we can identify the relevant HADM_IDs in the `diagnoses_icd` table, which will give us the hospital admissions where this diagnosis was recorded.\n- For each HADM_ID, we can determine the admission date (ADMITTIME) from the `admissions` table.\n- We need to identify patients who received the procedure \"sympath nerve inject nec\" within 2 months after the diagnosis.
